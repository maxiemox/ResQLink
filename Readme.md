Project Description
ResQLink is a web-based emergency assistance platform that allows users to request and manage help requests in real-time. It connects individuals in distress with relevant authorities and volunteers based on location and type of assistance needed.
________________________________________
The Problem Statement
During emergencies, people often struggle to get timely assistance due to lack of a centralized platform for reporting and tracking help requests. Existing solutions are either inefficient or inaccessible in critical situations.

The Solution
ResQLink provides a streamlined, user-friendly interface where people can quickly submit help requests. It categorizes requests based on urgency and type, enabling authorities and volunteers to respond effectively. The system maintains a database of all requests, ensuring proper tracking and timely resolution.
